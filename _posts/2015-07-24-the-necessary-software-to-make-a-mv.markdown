With recent advances in computer and video technology, it becomes easier than ever to create amateur music videos. Like any artistic endeavor, the process of recording a music video can be rewarding, frustrating, funny, trying, exhausting, and thrilling - sometimes all at once. 

In this article, we’ll explore the basics of the technical and creative processes that go into making music videos with My Merger. Music videos often employ special cinematic choices or visual effects to create a unique experience. If you plan to merge either into your video, be sure to incorporate them into your storyboard.

The storyboard doesn’t have to be flashy. They can be as simple as the position of actors and props in each scene, or they can be as detailed as individual cutaways, expressions, direction of movement, etc. As long as you have an idea of what is going to happen in each shot, and you can choose some pictures or video to merge them into the storyboard with My Merger.

Gradually, you will look to break your video into “scenes” that match your vision. If you are satisfied with them, you can merge the audio you record to the screen. Thus, a musical video has been made.
